    <string name="help_sync">As the user answers questions and runs events, the application will save the results in background. Every time user finishes an event or a questionnaire, the app will first try to send the results straight to the server, however, if internet connection is not available, the app will save the results locally. As of writing this guide, the results data that wasnt\'t sent to server straight after collection will be sent to the server once the user regains network access. If the user has enabled syncing over mobile network, then data will be sent either over mobile network or WIFI, depending on the availability. With the setting disabled, however, the data will only be sent over a WIFI connection. Please note, that as of right now, this setting only applies to bulk \"syncing\" which is done when the user regains internet access, if user has any type of internet connection while he/she is finishing an event or questionnaire, the results will always be sent straight to the server (because the amount of data sent in these queries is usually very small). The user can also press a \"Refresh button\" in \"My Studies\" view, which updates all the studies that the user is joined to and adds new studies, if the user has been assigned to one by an admin (but does not send results data to server). Studies, which the user has already joined, will also be updated during the background syncing mentioned above (bulk \"syncing\").</string>
    <string name="no_search_results">No Matching Studies Found</string>
    <string name="questionnaire_help">If a study has started, the app will automatically start sending questionnaires to the user, at a fixed rate, defined in the study. If a questionnaire arrives, a notification is shown in the system notification area at the top of the screen. There the user will have three options: \'OK\' will start the questionnaire, \'Refuse\' will skip it and \'Postpone\' will start the questionnaire at a later time, defined by the study itself (Postpone might not be allowed in all studies).</string>
    <string name="events_help">In \'My Studies\' view, the user can start events that are defined in the study, by pressing the \'Event\' button found next to the corresponding study. The user can then choose the type of event and press \'Start\', after which a notification will be shown in the system notification area, showing the name of currently running event and also elapsed time. This info is also available in \'My Events\' view. User can press on \'Stop\' button to stop the event, in both the notification and \'My Events\' view.</string>
